# EDA-of-Heart-attack-analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in analyzing and understanding a dataset before performing any modeling or statistical analysis. When it comes to heart attack analysis, EDA helps in gaining insights into the data, identifying patterns, relationships, and potential risk factors associated with heart attacks. Here are some steps and techniques you can use to perform EDA on a heart attack dataset:

1. Data Collection: Gather a comprehensive dataset containing relevant features and variables associated with heart attacks. This dataset can include information such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, smoking habits, family history, etc.

2. Data Cleaning: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers. Missing values can be imputed or removed based on the extent of missingness and the nature of the data. Duplicates should be identified and removed, as they can skew the analysis. Outliers, if present, need to be carefully examined to determine if they are erroneous data points or genuine observations.

3. Descriptive Statistics: Calculate summary statistics to obtain an overview of the dataset. This includes measures such as mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, quartiles, etc., for continuous variables. For categorical variables, calculate frequency counts and percentages for each category.

4. Univariate Analysis: Analyze each variable individually to understand its distribution and characteristics. For continuous variables like age or blood pressure, you can create histograms, box plots, or kernel density plots to visualize the distribution. For categorical variables like gender or smoking habits, create bar plots to show the frequency of each category.

5. Bivariate Analysis: Explore the relationships between variables and their impact on heart attacks. This can be done by creating scatter plots, heatmaps, or box plots to visualize the relationship between two continuous variables. For categorical variables, you can use bar plots or stacked bar plots to compare the occurrence of heart attacks across different categories.

6. Correlation Analysis: Calculate correlation coefficients, such as Pearson's correlation or Spearman's rank correlation, to measure the strength and direction of the linear relationship between variables. This helps identify potential risk factors that are strongly associated with heart attacks.

7. Feature Engineering: Based on domain knowledge and insights gained from the EDA, derive new features or transform existing features that could potentially improve the predictive power of your model. For example, you could create a new feature like "BMI" by combining height and weight information.

8. Visualization: Utilize various visualization techniques like scatter plots, heatmaps, pair plots, or correlation matrices to gain a deeper understanding of the relationships and patterns present in the data. Visualizations can help identify trends, outliers, and potential confounding factors.

9. Hypothesis Testing: Perform statistical tests, such as t-tests or chi-square tests, to validate assumptions, compare groups, and identify significant differences between variables. This can help identify variables that are statistically significant in relation to heart attacks.

10. Summarize Findings: Summarize the key findings from your EDA, highlighting the variables that show strong associations with heart attacks and potential risk factors. These insights can guide the subsequent steps of your analysis, such as feature selection, model building, and evaluation.

Remember, EDA is an iterative process, and you may need to revisit and refine your analysis based on the insights gained along the way.
